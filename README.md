# ao3random
AO3 Random is a web application that enhances your AO3 (Archive of Our Own) experience by helping indecisive readers or those looking to discover new works without having to scroll through long lists.
Given a URL from AO3 that shows a list of fanfics (such as user bookmarks, a search result, or reading history), this web app will randomly select a fanfic from the list and open it in a new tab.
